# Starter Project Improvements

This document outlines minimal, high-impact improvements to enhance the fullstack starter project while keeping it simple and focused.

## Essential Documentation

- [X] **Create comprehensive README** with setup instructions, project structure explanation, and common commands
- [ ] **Enhance API documentation** using existing Swagger setup with better examples

## Code Quality (Minimal Changes)

- [x] **Improve error handling in API** with a consistent error response format
- [x] **Enhance input validation** using existing class-validator setup more thoroughly
- [ ] **Improve TypeScript usage** in shared types for better type safety

## Development Experience

- [x] **Add improved scripts** in package.json for common development tasks
- [x] **Implement better logging setup** for debugging during development
- [ ] **Create environment-specific configurations** (dev/staging/prod) without complex tooling

## Testing Enhancements

- [ ] **Add more test examples** showing different testing patterns
- [ ] **Create test utilities** for common testing scenarios
- [ ] **Improve E2E tests** with better setup and teardown

## Configuration

- [x] **Implement environment variable validation** to catch missing configs early
- [x] **Add default configurations** that work out-of-the-box
- [ ] **Ensure clear separation** between development and production settings

## DevOps & CI/CD

- [ ] **Add GitHub Actions workflow** for automated building, testing, and Docker image creation
- [ ] **Configure multi-stage Docker builds** for optimized production images
- [ ] **Set up automated dependency updates** and security scanning

## Security & Authentication

- [ ] **Implement basic authentication** (JWT-based for API endpoints)
- [ ] **Add security headers** (helmet, CORS configuration, rate limiting)

## Frontend Enhancements

- [ ] **Add React Router** for multi-page navigation and routing

## Development Workflow

- [ ] **Add pre-commit hooks** (husky for linting and test enforcement)
- [ ] **Set up security scanning** (Dependabot for automated vulnerability checks)

## Community & Documentation

- [ ] **Create contributing guidelines** (CONTRIBUTING.md for open-source contributions)
